To use NumPy under MinPy, you only need to replace `import numpy as np` with `import minpy.numpy as np` at the header of your NumPy program. if you are not familiar with NumPy, you may want to look up [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html) for more details.\n",
